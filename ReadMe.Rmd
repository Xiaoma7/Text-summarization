## Text summarization overview

Text mining and natural language processing have been trending topics in the field of data science. In this project, I build a R application that can summarize articles of different formats in a few number of sentences, as well as extracting a number of keywords from the ariticle.

The are two main categoires in the approaches to text summarization:  

* **Extractive Summarization**: This approach relys on extracting the most important phrases or sentences from the text, without rephrasing them or creating new words. The goal is to find segments of the text that can best represent its overall idea.
    
* **Abstractive Summarization**:This method uses more advanced natural language processing techniques that generates new sentences or phrases that summarize the text.  
    
In this project, I will be focusing on the Extractive summarization techinque. In particular, I will be using a text ranking algorithms called [**LexRank**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/jair/pub/volume22/erkan04a-html/erkan04a.html), which is an unsupervised text summarization algorithm using graph-based centrality to score sentences.

## Data Preparation  

The aim for the final product is that it can handle a variety types of article inputs, including articles from the web, or documents from local computer in common document formats such as pdf, word, or text documents. This will require different ways of importing data.  

### Importing articles from web page  

In order to import articles from the web, I use the **xml2** and **rvest** packages. 

```{r}
library(xml2)
library(rvest)
```  

For example, take this [**news article**](https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/man-charged-in-shooting-on-cta-blue-line-train-near-uic/2214257/) from NBC Chicago as our article to summarize.  

First use the read_html function reads in the whole web data set.  

```{r}
webpage <- read_html("https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/man-charged-in-shooting-on-cta-blue-line-train-near-uic/2214257/")
```  

Next, use the html_text function to extract only the texts from the web data.  

```{r}
web_text <-  rvest::html_text(rvest::html_nodes(webpage, "p"))

# Take a look at first few lines
cat(web_text[1:10], sep = "\n")
```  

### Importing article from local documents  

The readtext package in r is a very versatile package that can reads in various forms of documents including '.csv', '.tab', '.json', '.xml', '.html', '.pdf', '.doc', '.docx', '.rtf', '.xls', '.xlsx', and others. This is perfect for our purpose.  

Taking the pdf task assignment document I got for a data scientist interview at UIC for example.  

```{r}
library(readtext)
pdf_text <- readtext("C:/Users/Ruochen/Desktop/Project/uic/Data Scientist Technical Assignment.pdf")

# Taking a look
cat(pdf_text$text, sep = "\n")
```  

## Running LexRank  

The LexRank algorithm essentially rank the sentences in the original text, giving a importance score to each. We can get a summary of the article by extracting the top few sentences with the highest rankings.  

Let's use the NBC Chicago news as an example. Applying LexRank algorithm on it:  

```{r}
library(lexRankr)
top_4 <- lexRankr::lexRank(web_text,
                           docId = rep(1, length(web_text)),
                           #return 4 summary sentences
                           n = 4,
                           continuous = TRUE)
top_4
```  

Here we get the top 4 ranked sentences from the article by specifying n = 4. We created identical docID for all elements in the input vector because there is only 1 document.  

The sentence ID represnet the order in which these sentences appear in the article. To make it more readable, we also sort the output in the article order.  

```{r}
library(dplyr)
# making sentence id numeric for sorting
top_4$sentenceId <- as.numeric(gsub("_",".",top_4$sentenceId)) 

summary_text <- top_4 %>% arrange(sentenceId) %>% select(sentence)
colnames(summary_text) <- "Article Summary"
cat(summary_text$`Article Summary`, sep = "\n")
```  

Here you have it! The summary of the article in 4 sentences.  

## Further Investigation  

### Keywords  

To take it further, another way to summarize text is to extract keywords from it. The basic approach for extracting keywords is finding the words that are most frequently occuring and occur somehow together in a plain text. There are more sophisticate methods of extracting the keywords that not only consider their frequency of occurence, but also things like the type of words (noun, adj, verb) and their interaction with other words in the article. Here I use the [**Textrank**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/textrank/vignettes/textrank.html) algorithm to extract keywords from the article into multi-word phrases.  

Let's use the pdf article we read in earliear this time. Before applying the textrank algorithm, we first need to annotate the text. **Text Annotation**  in natural language processing is basically a way to label and break down the raw sentences to make it more understandable to a machine learning algorithm, and also avoid feeding too much information into the model that can lead to overfitting. This can be done using the **udpipe** package in R.  

```{r}
library(udpipe)
tagger <- udpipe_download_model("english")
tagger <- udpipe_load_model(tagger$file_model)
article <- as.data.frame(udpipe_annotate(tagger, pdf_text$text))
head(article)
```  

As you can see, this process breaks down the original article into pieces of information that the model can more easily read in. Next, we apply the textrank algorithm. Here I want to find the key phrases that are a combination of nouns and adjectives:  


```{r}
library(textrank)
# keywords
keywd <- textrank_keywords(article$lemma,
                          relevant = article$upos %in% c("NOUN", "ADJ"), sep = " ")
keyw <- keywd$keywords
keyw
```  

As you can see, the keywords are summarized by their frequency of occurence, as well as the thing called ngram, which is basically the number of co-occuring words in the phrase.  

If we are only interested in the key phrases with multiple words, we could specifiy ngram > 1:  

```{r}
keyw %>% filter(ngram > 1)
```  

### Visualization of keywords: Wordcloud  

To take it even one more step further, we can use a wordcloud to visually present the keywords in the article. The bigger the texts are in the graph, the more important or frequently occuring they are in the article. 

```{r}
library(wordcloud)
wordcloud(words = keyw$keyword, freq = keyw$freq, scale=c(4,0.5),colors = brewer.pal(6, "Dark2"), max.words = 20, min.freq = 1)
```

## Putting it all together: R shiny app

To combine all the work I did into something more presentable and user friendly, I built a shiny app that does article summarization using the methods discussed above. **You can access the app by clicking the link here** (https://ruo-ma.shinyapps.io/Article_Summarizer/).  

Please note that I am using a free version of the shiny app server so there is 25 hour limit on the active time the app can have each month. Please do not over stay. 

### Type of article source  

This app allows two types of article sources: 1) Link from the web, 2) Upload from local computer.  

![Mode selection](https://github.com/Xiaoma7/Text-summarization/blob/master/Capture1.PNG)  

If you are using the **Web page** mode, copy and paste the link to online article into the box:  

![Web Mode](https://github.com/Xiaoma7/Text-summarization/blob/master/Capture1.5.PNG)  

In the **Local file upload** mode, click on the "Browse" button and upload an article from your computer.  

![local mode](https://github.com/Xiaoma7/Text-summarization/blob/master/Capture3.PNG) 

Once you are done inputting the article, click on the **Summarize !** button to generate the summary sentences and keywords plots for the article:
